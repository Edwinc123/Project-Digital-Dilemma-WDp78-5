      <tr >
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Our teams creative thinking process was to split up the work, making sure we each understood the material and what we had to do.</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">We split up the work by article, which ever article we annotated we would work on. The homepage and CSS was worked on by all of us deciding what would be on it and how it would look.</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: top;">Our team feels the most proud how of the website looks, the amount of pages, and the link colors with hovering. This is because we all spent a long time trying to figure out how to make it looks pleasing and fit the criteria.</td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">What we found most difficult about the project was putting the annotations in the table with highlights and figuring out how to change the link color because that was the one that was not working for a long time.</td>

    <h3>What we could have improved on-</h3>
    <p>When our team finished the project we realized we could have improved on adding more colors to the website. Also adding more fonts and font sizes to each page to give it their own identity. And annotating our articles better with a different highlight color we could of also changed the border style and color for each page.  </p>
<h3>New Code Learned:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Use this code to highlight<mark> mark </mark ></li>
      <li>This is superscript<sup>sup</sup></li>
      <li>a:link, a:hover,a:vistited, a:active-This lets us design the weblinks how we want to in CSS. </li>
      <li>.../ or ../images/-This tells the computer to look inside our outside the folder.</li>
      <li>Use this code to underline: <u>u tag</U> </li>
      <li>Use this code to italicize: <i>i tag</i></li>
    </ul>
