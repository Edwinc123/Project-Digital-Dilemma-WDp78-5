      <td>In the film industry, key characters are put to rest because their actors have passed. Through digitization, these actors who have passed can be seen again in their films.</td>

      <td>People who miss these actors in their films are benefiting from this situation. Fans and critics who believe that the dead actors’ characters shouldn’t have come back, are being “emotionally harmed” in this situation.</td>
      <td>These impacts are not intended because the people who have digitized the actors received the permiss`aion of the family members to do so. This way there would be no disrespect or bad intentions between the CGI workers and the actors’ families. However, fans feel as if this is wrong to do.</td>
